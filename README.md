# Python Challenge

Python applied to two hypothetical real-world situation and datasets: PyBank and PyPoll.

## PyBank Steps

The task is to analyze district-wide, standardized, academic test results. You have access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

- Create a Python script for analyzing simple financial records from budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.
- The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
- The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll Steps

The task is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. The election_data.csv is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

- Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
  - The total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The total number of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote.
- The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
